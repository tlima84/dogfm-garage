# DOGFM Garage JS

Garage resource in JS based on https://github.com/ESX-Org/esx_garage and other ESX resources. 
I've made this only to learn how to code something using JS and FIVEM server. I'm not giving any support for this resource, 
but your advices are welcome.

-I've changed an ESX table 'owned_properties' adding a column named garage to store a garage name.
